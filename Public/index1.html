            <h1>Welcome to Our Graduation Probability Calculator.</h1>
        
            <p>In response to the growing challenges faced by students in South Asia, weâ€™ve created a powerful web tool to support academic success. Our platform helps students predict their graduation probability by evaluating crucial factors such as course difficulty, study hours, and extracurricular engagement. A high probability suggests that enrolling in the course is a promising choice, while a low probability triggers personalized recommendations to improve study habits and academic performance.</p>
            <p>
                Our tool uses Monte Carlo simulations to handle uncertainties and provide accurate predictions. By offering actionable insights and solutions, we aim to empower students to make informed decisions and enhance their chances of graduating successfully.</p>
